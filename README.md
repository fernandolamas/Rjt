 I have made this plugin for the Team Fortress Classic LATAM Community


This plugin provides a kit of tools to improve the pickup experience inside the server

Working commands are: !spect, !alltalkon, !alltalkoff, !spectchaton, !spectchatoff, !pm and !rates

## !alltalkon and off
It turns the alltalk on and off

## !spect
Moves every player to spectator

## !spectchaton and off
Enables or disables the spectator chat (say)

## !pm
Ends the prematch time instantly

## !rates (OUTDATED)
Suggest you which rates are the best working on the server
